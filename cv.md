### SUMMARY

I am a junior front-end developer. I am looking for a full-time job in a product company 
that seeks to make business and daily life better, more productive and convenient.
I am responsible, hard worker, purposeful, efficient, punctual, stress-resistant, fast learner and sociable.
My strengths are perseverance, tolerance, managerial abilities, creative
analytical thinking, positive mood.
\
To increase my chances to get a job offer, I have to improve my knowledge and fill my portfolio with pet-projects. 
I have experience of taking the courses, so I am sure that the course with a mentor is much more effective than self-study. 
Especially if the course allows to make project in a team.
\
The first goal for now is to get a position as a junior front-end developer.
\
I have a lot of energy and I really want to learn, listen, and take knowledge from experienced professionals. 
For the past few months, I have been fallowing the rule “not a day without a line of code”. You can check it and find my projects on my GitHub account
